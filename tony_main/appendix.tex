%Dear Prof. Abel M{\'e}ndez

%\bigskip\noindent
%It is my understanding that the Planetary Habitability Laboratory (PHL), which is directed by you, is the copyright holder for the following material:

%Figure 1. ``Comparison of the liquid water volume of Earth, Europa, and Titan to scale.  CREDIT: PHL @ UPR Arecibo, NASA". In: \textit{Liquid Water in the Solar System}.\\(http://phl.upr.edu/library/media/liquidwaterinthesolarsystem)

%\bigskip\noindent
%I would like to adapt this figure in a doctoral thesis which I am currently undertaking at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia. The subject of my research is Improving Simulations of Aqueous Systems through Experimental Bias. I am carrying out this research in my own right and in association with the Industry Doctoral Training Centre (IDTC), where travel funds are provided by an industry sponsor, Cray Inc.
